## :basecamp: TL;DR    
This project is all about looking at the information from London's bikesharing rides to learn interesting things. I used a set of data from Kaggle that tells us about how many people use bikes in London and what the weather was like when they did. I created five special pictures (visualizations) to help us understand this information better.

## :basecamp: 1. How Many Bike Rides?
The first visualization provides an overview of the total bike rides count over the selected date range. This high-level summary sets the stage for a deeper exploration of the dataset, revealing overall trends in bike usage.    

*Insights: Identify peak periods of bike usage, enabling strategic resource allocation and infrastructure planning*

## :basecamp: 2. Weather Matters: Hot or Windy?
The second visualization delves into the relationship between temperature and wind speed over a user-selected date range. The heatmap allows users to identify potential correlations between weather conditions and bike rides.    

*Insights: Uncover patterns in bike rides corresponding to specific weather conditions, aiding in weather-informed decision-making.*
