## :basecamp: TL;DR    
This project is all about looking at the information from London's bikesharing rides to learn interesting things. I used a set of data from Kaggle that tells us about how many people use bikes in London and what the weather was like when they did. I created five special pictures (visualizations) to help us understand this information better.
