## :basecamp: TL;DR    
This project is all about looking at the information from London's bikesharing rides to learn interesting things. I used a set of data from Kaggle that tells us about how many people use bikes in London and what the weather was like when they did. I created five special pictures (visualizations) to help us understand this information better.

**Insights**     
I found out that lots of people want to use bikes from 7 am to 10 am and 4 pm to 9 pm, no matter if it's sunny, rainy, or windy.    

**What to Do**: To help people who use bikes to go to school or work, it's a good idea to have more bikes available during these times. This way, there will be enough bikes for everyone who needs them.    

**Why it's Important**:     

* Makes it easier for people to find bikes when they really need them.     
* Everyone will be happier because they can get a bike when they want one.     

## :basecamp: Important Questions
### :basecamp: 1. How Many Bike Rides?
The first visualization provides an overview of the total bike rides count over the selected date range. This high-level summary sets the stage for a deeper exploration of the dataset, revealing overall trends in bike usage.    

![Summary](https://github.com/sk-aili/bike-rides/assets/99275093/f9581410-820c-4d57-949d-6b3d4f030827)

### :basecamp: 2. Weather Matters: Hot or Windy?
The second visualization delves into the relationship between temperature and wind speed over a user-selected date range. The heatmap allows users to identify potential correlations between weather conditions and bike rides.

### :basecamp: 3. Days that Stand Out: Moving Average Scatter Plot
The third visualization introduces a moving average scatter plot, focusing on user-selected days. This dynamic approach provides a granular view of bike ride trends over time, smoothing out noise and highlighting underlying patterns.

### :basecamp: 4. Weather Categories and Number of Rides
The fourth visualization categorizes bike rides based on weather conditions, offering a breakdown of ride counts for each weather category within the user-selected date range.

### :basecamp: 5. Hourly Bike Rides Distribution: What Time is Busy?
The fifth visualization examines the hourly distribution of bike rides throughout the day, providing a detailed breakdown for the user-selected date range.

## üèÅ Conclusion
These visualizations help us understand how people use bike sharing in London. We can use this information to make decisions that will make bike sharing even better for everyone!

## Thank you!
